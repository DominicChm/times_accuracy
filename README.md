# times_accuracy

"dblquad", "mp-ts", "Fortran", and "C" are calculated in `stud_range_scipy.py` since I didn't want to mess up my development environment by adding statsmodels to it. 

"psturng" is calculated before generating the plots in `stud_range_make_plots.py`.

#### Some calculations created conditions `psturng` to fail, and I caught this error set the result to 2 so it would still appear on the graph. (Seen in the 10^0) range for magnitude difference).
